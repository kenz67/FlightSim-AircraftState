## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full stack developer with over 30 years experience.  I used to use older version of Micrsoft Flight Simulator (up to FS9) before taking a long break from the hobby.

I was drawn back when MSFS2020 came out and have since build a small home cockpit with a mixture of home built button boxes and store bought components.

This is my first attempt at writing software to integrate with the simulator.


## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank all of those other developers with samples and explanations online.  I reviewed many other apps/samples in order to learn how to interface with simconnect.
